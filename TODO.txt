__General__
- The whole project should be object oriented for better high-level control
- Logging should be implemented to better keep track of what is going on.

__0D Scripts__
- Pacing scripts should be better at determining wether the cell is firing properly. As it is now, the results are nonsensical for very short BCLs.
- Pacing scripts should be able to detect and handle alterans.
- The S1-S2 pacing functionality does not support plotting as it stands.

__1D Scripts__
- These scripts have not been brough up-to-date. Among other things, beatadjoint should be updated to cbcbeat.

__2D Scripts__
- These scripts have not been brough up-to-date. Among other things, beatadjoint should be updated to cbcbeat.
